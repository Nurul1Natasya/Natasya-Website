      <p>I have to share a song that's been on repeat for me lately which is <b>Strawberry Champagne by Dept</b>. I really like this song because it gives me this incredibly calm feeling when I hear it. 
         Seriously, I think I play this song almost ten times a day ‚Äì that's how much I love it! And I know it's not good to gatekeep something this good, so I wanted to share it with all of you reading this.
          And the lyrics really hit me in a sentimental way. There's this one part that just sticks with me:
          <pre>
          "Life just as sweet as saline
          I guess that's just how it is
          I'll wait for a life like honey to reach my lips". 
          </pre></p>
       <p>I really like this part of the song, because it means life is rough and harsh, but I will be waiting for the sweet ending I will achieve later.

    <p>Speaking of things I love, if you ask any of my friends what my favorite food is, they will, without a doubt, mention <b>Kuey Teow Goreng!</b> Seriously, the dish is absolutely to die for! 
       Every time I step foot in a food stall, I will always order the same thing. And while I sometimes try other things, Kuey Teow Goreng will always hold a special place in my heart. 
       But honestly, nothing, and I mean nothing, compares to my mom‚Äôs Kuey Teow Goreng. Ahhh, just looking at the pictures and writing about it makes me want to go home right now and beg my mom to cook it! üçú</p>

    <p>And what's Kuey Teow Goreng without its perfect companion? For me, that's definitely <b>Milo Ais!</b> It's hands-down my favorite drink. I just adore its creamy consistency, perfect sweetness, and that coolness. 
       It's absolutely perfect for combating hot weather. 
       Of course, I don't drink it every day ‚Äì remember that sweet drinks aren't the healthiest choice, right? But for that occasional treat, it's unbeatable. üíñ</p>

     <p>The people who are close to me can definitely tell I'm a big fan of Korean Dramas! But not the romance genre. I much prefer the action genre because it gives me such a rush of excitement and an adrenaline boost when I'm watching. One of my current obsessions is <b>"A Shop For Killers"</b>, starring the incredible Lee Dong Wook and Kim Hye Joon. 
        It tells the story of Jeong Ji An (Kim Hye Joon), who is the niece of Jeong Jin Man (Lee Dong Wook). When Jeong Ji An returns to her uncle's house after news of his death, she starts to uncover dark secrets, one by one, about his true, hidden identity. 
        I seriously love this drama because it's so fast-paced, and every single episode is packed with amazing, interesting action scenes. 
       Plus, it's only got 8 episodes, which is perfect for a quick binge! Highly recommend it if you're into action-packed mysteries! üé¨ <span style="font-size: 19px;">Check out the trailer below!</span></p>

    <p>Honestly, it's really hard to pick a single favorite movie because I'm a huge film lover! I watch a ton of movies from all over the world ‚Äì Thailand, Korea, Japan, Italy, America ‚Äì you name it. But if I had to choose one that's really captured my interest right now, it would be the American comedy <b>"One Of Them Days"</b>, starring Keke Palmer and one of my favorite singers, SZA. 
       This movie is pure comedy gold. I found myself laughing throughout the entire watch. It's a story about best friends, Dreux (Keke Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA), as they navigate the chaotic challenges of collecting money to pay rent after Alyssa's boyfriend runs off with their money. 
       While the movie is bursting with hilarious moments, it also carries a beautiful, sentimental message about the strength of friendship. 
       I absolutely love their bond; even though they face so many challenges, they stick together, solve problems as a team, and never leave each other behind. It's truly heartwarming! üçø <span style="font-size: 19px;">Check out the trailer below!</span></p>

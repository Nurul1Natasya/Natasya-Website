      <p>This is a picture of us as a family. It was taken when I enrolled in this university in 2023. 
         From the left are my father, younger sister, myself, my mother, and my older sister. We have a very close relationship. I often talk about my life with my siblings. 
         Every time, I come home during the holidays, we will spend time together sharing stories, gossiping, and other things. I love my family!</p>

         She is 51 years old this year. My mother is a friendly person. She likes to greet new people and get to know them. 
         My mother is also a very good cook. In my opinion, her cooking is the most delicious in this world. My father's name is <b><font color="#645dd7">Wahab Bin Omar</font></b>. 
         He is 55 years old. My father looks very fierce to some people who don't know him but he is actually a nice person when chatting. He always pampers me by fulfilling my requests to buy something I want. 
         In fact, most of my novels are sponsored by him.</p>

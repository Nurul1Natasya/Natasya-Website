   <p>I was just a little munchkin, barely four years old, when I first stepped into the world of education at <u>Tadika Kampung Baru, Serada</u>. Honestly, my memories from that time are a bit hazy. 
      I mean, I was still so young, right? But there is one memory that I still remember is that every time I came home from school, I would ask my mother to go to the store to buy sweets. 
      The good old days when a trip to the store was the highlight of my afternoon!</p>

    <p>After 2 years of studying in Tadika, I also entered <u>Prasekolah Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Baharu Serada</u> at the age of 6. Preschool for me is very fun because every time I go there I have only one goal - to play! 
       I know, I know, it probably sounds like I had my priorities a bit mixed up â€“ school's for studying, right? But honestly, my little six-year-old self was just there for the fun. 
       Luckily, my awesome teachers totally understood. They did a fantastic job balancing our study time with plenty of playtime, so it wasn't all just games.</p>

 <p>This is my picture back in my elementary school days at <u>Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Baharu Serada</u>. This picture was taken when we had the UPSR (Primary School Achievement Test) camp at a hotel. 
       That was like a mini vacation with all my friends, even if it was technically for studying! Elementary school truly felt like the best time when I didn't have to think about anything at all, just playing with my friends and gossiping with them. 
       The fun didn't stop when the school bell rang either. After school, my friends and I would always make a mandatory stop at an aunt's shop to buy snacks and just hang out together before my mom finally picked me up. 
       Those were some of the most fun memories, simple yet so precious.</p></div>

    <p>After those amazing primary school years, I moved on to <u>Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Padang Midin</u>, where I studied from 2018 to 2022. Honestly, my high school days were a bit of a different story compared to elementary and even university. 
       They felt less interesting, but I'm incredibly grateful because I had one super close friend who really helped me get through it all. When I first started high school, I felt pretty overwhelmed because the subjects seemed so difficult, and I struggled to keep up. 
       It was a tough period, but I was genuinely surprised when my SPM (Malaysain Certificate of Education) examination results came out, and I passed with flying colors! 
       Even though I might not have a ton of wild, wonderful memories from those years, there's still a part of me that misses going back to that time.</p>

    <p>And now, here I am, pursuing my Diploma of Library Informatics at <u>Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Sungai Petani!</u> When I first stepped into the campus for my first semester in 2023, I felt so overwhelmed and, honestly, pretty homesick. 
       This was my first time truly being away from my family, making the big move from Terengganu all the way to Kedah. But, as time went by, that feeling gradually faded away, replaced with a much happier one. 
       That's all thanks to the incredibly supportive friends I've made here who've accompanied me through my days in Kedah. Now, I've already entered Semester 4, which means just two more semesters before I graduate with my diploma! 
       I'm really hoping I can continue to stay strong and push through this final period of learning so I can become a great person! Wish me luck! ðŸŽ“</p>
